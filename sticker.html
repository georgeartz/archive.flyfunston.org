	<p> To fly hang gliders at Fort Funston: Per our GGNRA Special Use Permit, pilots must display a current Funston sticker on their helmet. Stickers expire on December 31 of each year. </p>
	<p>To receive a helmet sticker you must:</p>
	<ul>
        <li>Be a current  member of USHPA with a rating of H-3 or higher.</li>
        <li>Complete and sign a membership application, agreeing to abide by the club rules and site regulations.<a href="site.html"> Club Rules</a></li>
      </ul>
<p>There are two types of membership  at Fort Funston; Non-Clubhouse, and Clubhouse. All stickered pilots are  members of one type or the other:</p>
      <ol>
      <li><strong>Non-Clubhouse Members</strong>: Non-Clubhouse members are  pilots who just want to fly at Fort Funston. They have agreed to the club rules and submitted a Non-Clubhouse Member Application. Annual dues for Non-Clubhouse members are optional but greatly appreciated!</li>
	<br />
      <li><strong>Clubhouse Members</strong>: Clubhouse members are  pilots who want to fly and would also like a glider space in the Clubhouse. They have agreed to the club rules and submitted a Clubhouse Member Application &amp;  Clubhouse Waiver. Clubhouse members must pay annual  dues.</li>
      </ol>
    <p><strong>Sticker  by Mail:</strong> Pilots who have already flown at Fort Funston and have had a sticker are eligible to renew their membership and get a new sticker by mail. This is the best way to not miss any flying!<em> <strong>Note:</strong></em> Pilots who have never flown at Fort Funston must have a site intro before getting their sticker and are not eligible for sticker-by-mail until their second year. Please contact a club officer or Mentor to setup a site intro.</p>
<p>To receive your sticker by mail, please send in the following items:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Either a signed Clubhouse, or  Non-Clubhouse Member Application found here:</li> 
	<ul>
	<li><a href="documents/FFClubhousemember.pdf">Clubhouse Member Application Package (includes Clubhouse Waiver)</a></li>
	<li><a href="documents/FFNonclubhousemember.pdf">Non-Clubhouse Member Application</a></li>
	</ul>
        <li>Annual dues and/or  optional donation, may use button, below*.</li>
        <li>A self addressed stamped envelope. This is a *MUST*. Please do your part by stamping and addressing your own envelope!</li>

      <p><strong>Sticker in Person:</strong> To get a sticker in person you will need to find a club officer or other club member who has been entrusted to issue stickers. There's often  someone  on site if you  ask around, but no guarantees so it's better to get it by mail ahead of time!</p>
