	<p> To fly hang gliders at Fort Funston: Per our GGNRA Special Use Permit, pilots must display a current Funston sticker on their helmet. Stickers expire on December 31 of each year. </p>
	<p>To receive a helmet sticker you must:</p>
	<ul>
        <li>Be a current  member of USHPA with a rating of H-3 or higher.</li>
        <li>Complete and sign a membership application, agreeing to abide by the club rules and site regulations.<a href="site.html"> Club Rules</a></li>
      </ul>
<p>There are two types of membership  at Fort Funston; Non-Clubhouse, and Clubhouse. All stickered pilots are  members of one type or the other:</p>
      <ol>
      <li><strong>Non-Clubhouse Members</strong>: Non-Clubhouse members are  pilots who just want to fly at Fort Funston. They have agreed to the club rules and submitted a Non-Clubhouse Member Application. Annual dues for Non-Clubhouse members are optional but greatly appreciated!</li>
	<br />
      <li><strong>Clubhouse Members</strong>: Clubhouse members are  pilots who want to fly and would also like a glider space in the Clubhouse. They have agreed to the club rules and submitted a Clubhouse Member Application &amp;  Clubhouse Waiver. Clubhouse members must pay annual  dues.</li>
      </ol>
    <p><strong>Sticker  by Mail:</strong> Pilots who have already flown at Fort Funston and have had a sticker are eligible to renew their membership and get a new sticker by mail. This is the best way to not miss any flying!<em> <strong>Note:</strong></em> Pilots who have never flown at Fort Funston must have a site intro before getting their sticker and are not eligible for sticker-by-mail until their second year. Please contact a club officer or Mentor to setup a site intro.</p>
<p>To receive your sticker by mail, please see <a href="https://www.fellowfeathers.com/">the new Fellow Feathers website.</p>
